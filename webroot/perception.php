             <p>The way you're perceived has a tremendous impact. 
             Since people can only form an opinion off vision, 
             you should think about your appearance before you make an entrance.
             Yes of course it's about what's inside but how often would you purchase
             a house if the frontal is not up to par. you are as well showcasing features
             that might be beneficial for your future and business   </p>

<p class="w3-text-teal w3-large w3-center w3-opacity"><i><b>Education is the ultimate divider<br> between the wealthy and impoverished.</b></i></p> 
    <p>Having an education could potentialy extend your ability to be more intellectually involved
       in voting, political interest, governmental officiating, and changing laws.</p>
    <p class="w3-text-teal w3-large w3-center w3-opacity"><i><b>Technology has evolved, extending more access to classes
       and coarses in efforts to obtain an education.</b></i></p>
    <p>Even though the ease of entertainment is less complex, the role of the wealthy
       and educated is less controversal and more relaxed. As you can imagine with an education
       you awarded more gateways to security and finacial stablilty.
       Having an education also decreases you chancees of being fleeced or swindled
       because it's simple to exploite or take advantage of the illiterate uneducated.
       The uneducated can be fooled into to signing invalid documents or denied rights
       which they legally have but are unable to dispute due lack of education.</p>

  <p class="w3-large w3-center">It's no conspiracy you produce what you think, 
                    nor is it a conspiracy that you are observed by how you dress.
                    It's a big difference in dressing to impress then making a first impression in objective of success. 
                    How you look can also shape how you feel and mold the energy you attract. 
                    I believe I should remind to dress just as sophisticated as you act. 
                    Act just as sophisticated as you dress. Don't just be the most well perceived, be the most sharp and prestige. </p>

                    Reclassify reality with brown, or darken to shed luminous
                    on the infatuation of day and not night. Your identity should carry
                    class and sophistication. What you identify as, will have an imminent impact on how you think.

                    you plan to attract. When engaging in the world of business I strongly
                    suggest you dress with prestige and pizazz. It's extremely
                    important to address the world with class, your verbage is
                    just as important I must add. To no avail, time will tell

                <p>	There are more idols pertaining to business than compassion. 
                    Which makes it's easy to be misadvised. 
                    Always idolize those with significant intellectual achievements.
                    Often, we go intrigued by performance of what we see instead of the richest
                    we stand to gain from articles, books, and advanced novelties.
                    An idol leads by example in showing solidarity, leadership, and positive direction.  </p>
